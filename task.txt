=> The alert function that captures the api request data message and the 
   details from the message its enable the reversal plus and signal exit 
   checked boxes enable true or false its triggered the close symbol
=> The small database like sqlite or something not postgres or big database
   its stores the detail and another data to the that.


15/11/2025

=> Use the flutter sqflite package to create the table and manage the trade
   transaction in the frontend 
=> Use the rustsqlite crate to manage the trade transactions in the backend 
   if the frontend call the backend for response then we send the status from
   the rustsqlite
=> Main thing is the reversal plus,signal exit,tc change are the boolean values
   that attached to a data of the openfn to the backend and the logic of the 
   boolean value are executed in backend ,if the boolean value is true then the 
   backend server calls the other api service for the response and when the 
   response gets its gets the alert then call the close function and update the
   rustsqlite symbol closed status in the table,when the time of frontend ask for 
   the symbol close or anything then we provide the status we managed in the 
   rustsqlite
=> if the close status are the new details are get from the backend and then frontend
   widget state are rebuild for the value clearance

Additional Ideas:
=> The frontend database use sqflite then the symbol and the details are managed in
   the table

=> Complete the plan but the remaining changes and their solution:

   * The close function in trade server close fn called and it directly call the 
     meta api trader but first its check the db for api status (status) and check
     the status is completed or not if its completed then the frontend msg to be
     its already closed and backend need not to be call the api of meta trader
   
=> 21/11/2025

   => The planned db changes are almost completed waiting for the verify


=> 10/12/2025
   => The trade close using only symbol not the position id
   => The api status method should be web socket for the request and 
      immediate change of the including boolean factors trade
   => Divergence response/request to be {Divergence-> name,symbol,Green/Red} 

--------------> 19/12/2025 -> Important final update

   => Trading app reversal plus and that section will be saved in local storage 
      until the manually clear the checked box if the reversal plus or other
      checked box is enable if we close the app and then we open it again
      the checked box status remain same as we set 
   
   => the trade server api_status method is triggered the close function,when 
      the request comes to the api_status handler then the handler check the symbol first 
      if it is the same symbol is opened in the trade row then check the row columns
      reversal plus or signal exit or tc change is true if it is true then will be next step 
      the message request like (XAUUSD-SIGNAL-EXIT) if like this then close the XAUUSD even 
      id ORDER_TYPE_BUY or ORDER_TYPE_SELL  ,the mesage will be like(XAUUSD-TC-DOWN) then the 
      XAUUSD symbol row in the row with open check the order_type ,the order type of the XAUUSD
      in the row is ORDER_TYPE_BUY then the close function triggered like the 
      {
         "symbol": "XAUUSD", 
         "action_type": "POSITIONS_CLOSE_SYMBOL", 
         "description": "TC-DOWN",
      }
      the message is XAUUSD-TC-UP then reverse the logic  => find the symbol in row and check the
      order_type the order_type is ORDER_TYPE_SELL then the close fn triggered like 
      {
         "symbol": "XAUUSD", 
         "action_type": "POSITIONS_CLOSE_SYMBOL", 
         "description": "TC-UP",
      }

   => reversal plus concept is bullish reversal then close the buy and bearish is reversal then close the
      sell in the same symbol the format like( XAUUSD-ReversalPlus-Bearish reversal + ) and 
      ( XAUUSD-ReversalPlus-Bullish reversal + )

   => in table update the reason alos for the closing the trade in the row 

   => Divergence and the function executed the updation to be live on the  Ui so change the server as websocket
