--------------> 19/12/2025 -> Important final update

   => Trading app reversal plus and that section will be saved in local storage 
      until the manually clear the checked box if the reversal plus or other
      checked box is enable if we close the app and then we open it again
      the checked box status remain same as we set 
   
   => the trade server api_status method is triggered the close function,when 
      the request comes to the api_status handler then the handler check the symbol first 
      if it is the same symbol is opened in the trade row then check the row columns
      reversal plus or signal exit or tc change is true if it is true then will be next step 
      the message request like (XAUUSD-SIGNAL-EXIT) if like this then close the XAUUSD even 
      id ORDER_TYPE_BUY or ORDER_TYPE_SELL  ,the mesage will be like(XAUUSD-TC-DOWN) then the 
      XAUUSD symbol row in the row with open check the order_type ,the order type of the XAUUSD
      in the row is ORDER_TYPE_BUY then the close function triggered like the 
      {
         "symbol": "XAUUSD", 
         "action_type": "POSITIONS_CLOSE_SYMBOL", 
         "description": "TC-DOWN",
      }
      the message is XAUUSD-TC-UP then reverse the logic  => find the symbol in row and check the
      order_type the order_type is ORDER_TYPE_SELL then the close fn triggered like 
      {
         "symbol": "XAUUSD", 
         "action_type": "POSITIONS_CLOSE_SYMBOL", 
         "description": "TC-UP",
      }

   => reversal plus concept is bullish reversal then close the buy and bearish is reversal then close the
      sell in the same symbol the format like( XAUUSD-ReversalPlus-Bearish reversal + ) and 
      ( XAUUSD-ReversalPlus-Bullish reversal + )
