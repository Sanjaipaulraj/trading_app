=> The alert function that captures the api request data message and the 
   details from the message its enable the reversal plus and signal exit 
   checked boxes enable true or false its triggered the close symbol

=> Use the flutter sqflite package to create the table and manage the trade
   transaction in the frontend 
=> Use the rustsqlite crate to manage the trade transactions in the backend 
   if the frontend call the backend for response then we send the status from
   the rustsqlite
=> Main thing is the reversal plus,signal exit,tc change are the boolean values
   that attached to a data of the openfn to the backend and the logic of the 
   boolean value are executed in backend ,if the boolean value is true then the 
   backend server calls the other api service for the response and when the 
   response gets its gets the alert then call the close function and update the
   rustsqlite symbol closed status in the table,when the time of frontend ask for 
   the symbol close or anything then we provide the status we managed in the 
   rustsqlite
=> if the close status are the new details are get from the backend and then frontend
   widget state are rebuild for the value clearance

Additional Ideas:
=> The frontend database use sqflite then the symbol and the details are managed in
   the table
